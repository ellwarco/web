    <p class="bf-excerpt"> Have you ever sat down to think about who manages the emails you received that are advertising products sold and services offered by a business close to you? The emails also usually somehow have an idea of what type of products you might need or be interested in. There definitely isn’t someone sitting behind a desk 24hrs a day collating data on you personally (like location, commonly used products, etc.) and then sending you a personalized email.  This is all happening through the use ofvarious types of artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms that are analysing large sets of data to send you just the right message.
AI is being used in a wide range of marketing use cases including Search Engine Optimization (SEO), email marketing, content curation,and much more.  Different tools have been developed that are already being used by different brands not only to make the lives of human marketers easier, but to make them a lot better at their jobs.</p>

    <p class="bf-excerpt"> The web is a place of never-ending change. Just when you think you’re hopping on board one trend, another comes whizzing by. That’s what makes design or marketing on the web such interesting jobs, because you always have to be on the lookout for the next big thing.

And what is the next big thing? Why, Progressive Web Apps of course! The changes brought by responsive web design have almost fully saturated through the entirety of the modern web. And now Progressive Web Apps- which offer the same functionality and feel as a native mobile app, but are accessed through the internet like other sites- are next up to change what we do and how we do it.

So, without further ado, here are four reasons why web apps have been a startling success.</p>

    <p class="bf-excerpt"> The variety of devices, screen sizes, and display resolutions makes quality scalability and responsiveness essential in providing your digital audience with an optimal experience. Some images may look fine at first glance, but as viewers start zooming in, they may begin to wonder if they need to grab their reading glasses to clear up the emerging blurriness.
